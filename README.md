# Distance Vector Routing

This repository contains an implementation of the **Distance Vector Routing Algorithm**, a key concept in computer networking used for dynamic routing in decentralized networks. The algorithm enables routers to determine the best path to send packets by exchanging information with their neighbors.

## Overview

Distance Vector Routing is a dynamic routing algorithm that helps network routers compute optimal paths based on their knowledge of neighboring nodes and their distance metrics. The key highlights include:
- Decentralized computation.
- Iterative convergence through information exchange.
- Resilient and adaptive in dynamic network topologies.

This project simulates the algorithm and demonstrates how it works in a given network topology.

## Features

- Simulation of distance vector exchange between routers.
- Real-time updates of routing tables.
- Example topologies to demonstrate dynamic routing.
- Written in [language] for simplicity and clarity.
